        <h2>This grilled Pizza Margherita is a showstopper!</h2>
        <h3>The easiest way to make pizza at home is to grill it. Crisp crust, melty cheese and all the basil.</h3>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Instant yeast</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Olive oil</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Warm water</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Canned Tomatoes</strong> -Try get San Marzano tomatoes if you can</li>
            <li><strong>Mozzarella</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Basil</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk the yeast and sugar into warm water and allow to stand for 5 minutes until frothy. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and salt. With the mixer running, pour in the yeast mixture. Add the olive oil then allow to knead for a few minutes until the dough is soft, smooth and only slightly tacky. If the dough is very sticky, add a little bit of flour and knead in. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover with plastic and allow to rise for at least 1 hour. I usually make the dough a few hours before cooking. Once risen, divide the dough into 4 and form into balls. Place on a floured board and cover with a dish cloth and allow to rise for another 30 minutes while you prepare the toppings</li>
            <li>To make the sauce, drain off any excess liquid from the tomatoes then crush the tomatoes into a bowl. Season with salt (and your chosen additions if using). Grate/tear the mozzarella and finely slice the basil</li>
            <li>Preheat the grill (braai/barbecue) to its hottest setting.</li>
            <li>Grill the pizza</li>
        </ol>
